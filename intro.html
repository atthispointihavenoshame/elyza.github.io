    <p>Hello, my name is Elyza Medina and I went to Hudson High School in New York before coming here to RIT. I like to do a mulititude of things like playing soccer, reading, and watching videos. A little more about me is that I have one older brother named Tony, and a fun fact about us is that we're 10 years apart!</p>
    <p> Here is my favorite food, it is called "pupusas" and even though I am Nicaraguan, I love this Salvadorian dish.</p>
